This project utilizes Stylelint to maintain consistency and quality in our CSS codebase. Stylelint helps us enforce coding standards and avoid common stylistic errors, making our development process more efficient and our final product more reliable.


## To run Stylelint on your CSS files, use the following npm script:

- (To check linting status) `npm run lint:scss`
- (To fix linting issues) `npm run lint:scss:fix`

## Building and linting scripts
 
- `npm run build` (see "build" directory for output)
